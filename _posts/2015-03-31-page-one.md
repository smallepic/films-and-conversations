In the tradition of great fly-on-the-wall documentaries, *Page One: Inside The New York Times* gains unprecedented access to The New York Times newsroom and the inner workings of the Media Desk.  With the Internet surpassing print as the main news source and newspapers all over the country going bankrupt, Page One chronicles the transformation of the media industry at its time of greatest turmoil.  It gives us an up-close look at the vibrant cross-cubicle debates and collaborations, tenacious jockeying for on-the-record quotes, and skilful page-one pitching that produce the ‘daily miracle’ of a great news organisation.  What emerges is a nuanced portrait of journalists continuing to produce extraordinary work under increasingly difficult circumstances.
