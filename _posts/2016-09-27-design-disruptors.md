    I’ve been putting together the September Films & Conversations for a while now and it’s a special one.

    This month, I’m partnering with Il Kino to present a screening of Design Disruptors which will be followed by a unique panel discussion.

    In recent years, we’ve seen design play a crucial role in ushering a new era products and services. And with this elevated status, designers are faced with profound responsibilities in their ability to influence the lives of people in the far reaches of the world.

    This film presents an opportunity to have a dialogue about the roles designers play in all our lives, so please join me for a great evening of film and conversation.
